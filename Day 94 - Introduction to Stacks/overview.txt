Definition of Stack:- 
 It is a linear data structure, in which insertion and deletion are only allowed at the end i.e. called top of the stack.

 When we define a stack as an abstract datatype, then we are only interested in know the stack operation from user point of view.

 It simply means, we are not interested in knowing the details, we are only interested in what type of Output we can perform.

Operations in Stack:- 
 - push 
 - pop 
 - top (peek)
 - size
 - empty

It follows LIFO (Last-in-first-out) method to perform operations.
